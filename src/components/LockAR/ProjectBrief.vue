                <p class="text-right"> The theme is related to the Vetenskapsrådet-funded research project "Precious Keys," currently led by Mehmet Aydın Baytaş, Assoc. Prof. Ylva Fernaeus (KTH/Umeå), and PhD student Andreas Lindegren (KTH). Projects which might make contributions to the research may be invited to continue. Possibilities include thesis projects; for-credit project course; research internships at Chalmers, KTH, and Umeå; and industrial internships at our collaborators which include Assa Abloy, ManyOne, and Volvo Cars. </p>
