      authors: 'Johan Martinson, Herman Jansson, Mukelabai Mukelabai, Thorsten Berger, Alexandre Bergel, Truong Ho-Quang',
      description: 'When developers maintain or evolve software, they often need to\n' +
        'know the locations of features. This proves challenging when the\n' +
        'feature locations are not documented, when the code was written\n' +
        'by different developers who may have left the organization, or\n' +
        'when the developerâ€™s memory of the implementation has faded.\n' +
        'Automated feature location techniques are hard to adopt in practice,\n' +
        'especially since they boast too many false positives. To address these\n' +
        'challenges, embedded feature annotations have been proposed to\n' +
        'allow developers to trace features in code during development with\n' +
        'minimal effort. However, tool support is needed for developers to\n' +
        'effectively record and use these annotations. We propose HAnS as a\n' +
        'tool to meet this need; it is implemented as an IntelliJ IDE plugin to\n' +
        'support developers seamlessly record feature locations while they\n' +
        'write their code. HAnS supports developers when mapping features\n' +
        'to software assets, such as files and code fragments, with code\n' +
        'completion and syntax highlighting. It also provides functionality to\n' +
        'browse feature definitions and locations, as well as refactor features.\n' +

      title: 'An IDE Plugin for Clone Management',
      authors: 'Ahmad Al Shihabi, Jan Sollmann, Johan Martinson, Wardah Mahmood, Thorsten Berger',
      description: 'Development and maintenance in variant-rich systems often involves the replication of specific software code, known as software\n' +
        'cloning. This process allows for code reuse but presents challenges\n' +
        'in managing independently evolving variants. This paper discusses\n' +
        'the necessity of effective clone management tools to maintain code\n' +
        'quality and efficiency. We present an extension1\n' +
        'to the HAnS IDE\n' +
        'plugin. This extension enhances the plugin by supporting basic\n' +
        'clone management, and by facilitating the tracking and synchronization of cloned assets and features through a well-designed,\n' +
        'lightweight trace database. The plugin is evaluated through unit\n' +
        'and integration testing, as well as user experiments, demonstrating its effectiveness in addressing the challenges associated with\n' +
        'software cloning. The evaluation results indicate that 80% of participants rated the trace database as intuitive, and 100% rated the\n' +
        'notification system as both intuitive and user-friendly.\n',
