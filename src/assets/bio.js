            I study at Chalmers University of technology where I am now doing my masters in Software 
            engineering and technology. I have previously studied Computer Engineering as a bachelors degree.
            As well as study I am involved in the board of Chalmers Handbollsklubb where my main 
            responsibilities are PR and coaching the men's team.\n

            `During the summers of my studies I have worked at Waya Finance & Technology where I learned how 
            a start-up works and a lot more about financial systems.\n

            Before my studies I worked a couple of months as a chef at BBQ Galore, that experience taught 
            me how to handle stressful situations, high tempo and customer service. I stopped working there 
            when I started the fourth semester at Chalmers.\n

            I work well in groups and work hard to get the work done as efficiently as possible without 
            loss of quality. I learn easiest by doing and like to try myself first and then ask for help if 
            I'm stuck. Besides that I am a person who always does the work I set out to do.
