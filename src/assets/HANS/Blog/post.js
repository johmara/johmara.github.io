                 During this week we have focused on finding what useful tools that we have available to us in IntelliJs
                 plugin development and in FAXE. IntelliJ has a thorough guide that shows how to create a plugin which is 
                 quite easy to follow and gives us a better understanding of how it works. IntelliJ's documentation have also
                 proved to be useful for finding what version of Java (JDK-11) we need to use as well as dependency manager, code 
                 conventions and recomended plugins for development. The FAXE tool contains everything we need for now. 
                 As we learn more about it we might have new requirements regarding FAXE's endpoints.

                reading and gaining better understanding of the available tools is also high on the list`,

                Exam week is comming to a close and the start of the project is inching closer. Our exams 
                ended earlier in the week so we have gotten a head start on the reading and group dynamics.
                We also got a start on the overarching planning of the next six months of our studies. The trello 
                board for userstories and tasks is also set up. We are just waiting for the institution to get back 
                to us regarding the proposal of the project and then we can get started for real!
