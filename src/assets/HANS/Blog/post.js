                Exam week is comming to a close and the start of the project is inching closer. Our exams 
                ended earlier in the week so we have gotten a head start on the reading and group dynamics.
                We also got a start on the overarching planning of the next six months of our studies. The trello 
                board for userstories and tasks is also set up. We are just waiting for the institution to get back 
                to us regarding the proposal of the project and then we can get started for real!
